# Preface {-}


This book supplements my presentation at the Omaha R User Group on Thursday, April 4, 2019.


## Intended Audience {-}

If you develop Shiny Applications and your back end is a relational database then this book is for you.  The demos and code snippets are written in T-SQL, Microsoft SQL Server dialect of SQL, but the core concepts are applicable across all RDBMS systems.

Data Scientists using R are the primary audience.  Database Developers, BI Developers, Software Engineers, Data Analysts and Managers wanting to learn more about Shiny Database applications will also benefit from the material.

The reader should have some experience writing R code or programming.  Any knowledge of SQL and relational databases will help but is not required.


## Software information {-}

My IDEs were Rstudio and SQL Server Management Studio.

I used R on windows and SQL Server to build the demo application.
